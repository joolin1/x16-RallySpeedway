# Rally Speedway
This is a topdown racing game for the retro computer Commander X16. If you ever played Rally Speedway for Commodore 64 or Atari, it will feel familiar. I consider it a late sequel, somewhat improved actually and hopefully still fun. It is best played by two players!

I have had great making this game! Graphics are made by mopspear (moptec.net). The music is by kliepatsch and is played with ZSound by ZeroByte.  
## Starting the game
All game files should be in the same directory. To start the emulator and directly load and run the game type: x16emu -joy1 -joy2 -prg rallyspeedway.prg -run

If you don't have any game controller, use the following keys:
- Ctrl = Button A
- Alt = Button B
- Enter = START
- Cursor Keys = UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT

With one controller, player 1 will use the game controller and player 2 the keyboard.
With two controllers, player 1 will use the first and player 2 the second.
## Controls
Up - Start the race when cars are in position
A Button - Brake (the cars will accelerate to maximum speed automatically)
B Button - Return to menu when race is finished
Start Button - Pause game
## Further instructions
This is an open world racing game. For every track there is a certain distance you have to drive. When you have driven the given distance, you are ready to cross any finish line you happen to find. Remaining distance is displayed in the bottom corner of the screen. Most of the time you will probably just drive the default route by following the road and continue straight ahead in every crossing if there isn't an arrow to point you in a certain direction. But you can also find your own way. Just remember that every time you crash or get too far away from the other car, the race will pause and you will be brought back to the default route. For every crash a penalty of one second is added to your time. This is also the case if you are outdistanced by the other player. You can only be outdistanced as long as the other player is on the road and driving the standard route.
